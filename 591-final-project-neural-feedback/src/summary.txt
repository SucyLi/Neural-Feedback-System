Project Name: Neural Network Motor Game

Description:
Autistic children perceive external environment atypically according to current research. 
This real-time neural feedback simulation system is to help children with Autism to learn how to perform motor tasks correctly. 
It will take neural data (fMRI) as the input, use machine learning classifier to classify the signal, 
show the classification result in 2 perspectives - clinician's view and kid's view. 
Clinician's GUI shows brain axial scans with expected and detected labels. 
Kid's GUI uses a balloon flight game to tell kids feedback if they are performing the task correctly. 

Team:
Benjamin Lopez Barba, Ervin Gan, Xinhui Li

Work Breakdown:
Benjamin: build Game GUI, add corresponding JUnit tests, record video \
Ervin: build machine learning classifiers, help with Game GUI, add corresponding JUnit tests, organize all libraries and scripts \
Xinhui: test machine learning classifiers, build Clinician GUI, preprocess fMRI data, add corresponding JUnit tests


Room for Improvement:

MACHINE LEARNING GUI

Improved Brain Imaging:
Use more data to have a less blurry view of the brain scans.

More Data Sets:
Use another data set for our simulation instead of our test data set which we already used to test our models

Backup:
Add a complete backup in case the game cannot read the data (meaning we press w to play) and more functionalities

Preprocessing: 
Add extraction code to extract features from raw NIfTI fMRI data

Machine Learning Improvements: 
1) train classifier with more data, tune parameters to improve test accuracy 2) try advanced classifiers like CNN+RNN

Clinician GUI: 
except showing axial scans, also offer sagittal and coronal view

Real-time Processing:
add a class to process real-time data input in real life, pass the input to clinician GUI and kid GUI simultaneously


GAME GUI

(design) Sprite Parent Class:
Had there been more sprite types that required movement, created a sprite abstract class or a sprite interface would have made sense.  
However, given that the balloon and sky were the only moving sprites, this was unnecessary for this project.

(design) Menu Parent Class:
There is currently a start menu and an end screen.  
Again, had there been more screens, a parent class could have made sense that bundled up some of the similar functionality.

(design) Bridge Class:
One key part of this project included coordinating communication between the game view and clinician view.  
It is possible we could have created a class dedicated to handling this communication.  
It could have been in charge of all game time and data sending.

(feature) Keyboard Input:
With more time, I would have liked to have created a version of the game that could be played with computer input.  
However, that was more as a bonus feature or nice to have than central to the project.
